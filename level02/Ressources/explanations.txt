----- LEVEL02 -----


1)	first impressions :
		-pcap file, I need a traffic analyzer to read it.

2)	installed tshark and wireshark
		-copied the file locally with scp

3)	used tshark with -V option to see the packages details.
		=> Not very readable but with a less, found a "Data" section.
			=> "tshark -V -r level02.pcap | grep -B 2 -A 2 Data
				=> found a "...Password:" packet followed by multiple 1 byte lines looking like password parts.
			=> "tshark -V -r level02.pcap | grep ^00"

5)	took some time to figure out that the 7f hex value was ASCII delete character
6)	found that the password was ft_waNDReL0L
