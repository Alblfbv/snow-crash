1)	first impressions :
		-lua script, might be server script as for perl and php
		-is a server already listening on port 5151 ?
			=> netstat -tulpn shows port 5151 is already in use.

2)	we have to send a password that will be hashed, with sha1sum.
		=> 40 characters will be kept and compared with actual good hash of the password
		=> reverse sha1 gives us password "NotSoEasy"
			=> Trying with netcat : echo NotSoEasy | nc 127.0.0.1 5151
				=> Not working

3)	copied the script on my machine to test it, and netcat adds a carriage return, hence the sha1sum not working.
		=> Replacing the sha1sum server side by the one with \n, I get the success message but.... no flag !
			=> But what did I expect, reading the server side script again, it's only a print, so I just lost my time.

4)	looking on the functions used on the script, I saw that popopen was vulnerable because executes bash commands.
		=> created a script, got the flag
