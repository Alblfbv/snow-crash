1)	first impressions :
		-file in home directory
		-pl extension => perl script
		-cat script shows localhost
			=> netstat -tulpn : something is listening on port 4747

2)	Found out apache2 server running.
		- listening on port 4747
		- ExecCGI
		- Executes perl script that is in home directory
		- Simple curl does nothing special

3)	Perl script analysis
		- use CGI qw{param} and param("arg")
			=> found out param is a function that will retrieve the value of URL parameter "arg"
		- so script calls subroutine x with value of URL parameter x
		- subroutine x does a print of result of shell invoke of "echo $y"
			=> $y is the value of first subroutine argument, so x URL value.
	
4)	Possible exploit is to insert shell command inside the backticks with URL parameter
		
5)	with curl :
		- after several attempts, got this one working
			=> curl -Gv '127.0.0.1:4747' --data-urlencode "x=;getflag"
