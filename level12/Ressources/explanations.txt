----- LEVEL12 -----


1)	first impressions :
		-perl script
		-netstat -tulpn
			=> 4646 is listening already

2)	script analysis
		-n is only here to say if t was successful or not
		-first regex is uppercase filter
			=> Command injection will be complicated because commands are case sensitive ?
		-second regex deletes all whitespaces and following characters.
		-as in level 11, the program in itself will not give us the flag, (returns "." or ". .")
			=> seems like we have to find a week spot for injection.
				=> line with egrep has backticks

3)	exploit must be first URL parameter string.
		=> without whitespaces
		=> which will work if written fully uppercase

4)	how to lowercase an uppercase command ? 
		=> https://www.shellscript.sh/tips/case/

	=> Solution 1) "x=\"</;EXPLOIT=\"/tmp/exploit.sh\";\${EXPLOIT,,};#"
		a) end egrep avec "</; => failure bcs directory
		b) declare shell variable EXPLOIT=/TMP/EXPLOIT.SH
		c) eval this variable in lowercase with ${VAR,,}
			=> perl uses sh, the lowercase eval syntax only works with bash :'(

	=> Solution 2) "x=\"</;/*/EXPLOIT.SH;#"
		a) same as 1)a)
		b) will look for a script named EXPLOIT.SH in all subdirectories of root
			=> Much easier that solution1 1 :')

5)	scripts overview :
		-EXPLOIT.SH script calls getflag and outputs the result in /tmp/exploit.txt 
		-curl.sh script executes curl with encoded url parameters.
		-perl_test.pl script helped me to observe locally the behavior of the executable rather than read logs in /var/log/apache2/{error.log / other_vhost_access.log}
