----- LEVEL01 -----


1)	first impressions :
		-again, nothing in the home directory.
		-tried the find / -user flag01 command again, no results.
		-checked sudoers file access, no access.
		-checked shadow file access, no access.

2)	after reading on passwords that are stored in /etc/shadow, I saw that their encoding was specified in /etc/passwd.
		=> cat /etc/passwd, and flag01 password was stored directly in this file ! (wtf ?)
		=> password : 42hDRfypTqqnw

3)	tried su flag01 with found password unsuccessfully.
		=> tried on password on dcode unsuccessfully
		=> then tried "john --show hashed_pwd"
			=> it worked : 42hDRfypTqqnw == abcdefg
