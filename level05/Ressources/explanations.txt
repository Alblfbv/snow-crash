----- LEVEL05 -----


1)	first impressions :
		-nothing in home directory.
		-tried to find usefull files like in level00 and level01
			=> find / -user flag05 2>/dev/null
			=> found a file "openarenaserver" in /usr/sbin/

2)	openarenaserver file :
		a) bash script that looks for files in /opt/openarenaserver/
		b) will execute every executable found in this directory ?
		c) removes the file
		d) has acl set,, but getfacl does not show anything important imo.
		=> I don't have permissions to execute it.
		=> even if I could execute it, the binary has no setuid, called binaries won't be executed as flag05

3)	A bit blocked at this point, did some more filesearches
		- find / -user level05 2>/dev/null
		- find / -name flag05 2>/dev/null
		- find / -name level05 2>/dev/null
			=> /var/mail/level05
				cat => */2 * * * * su -c "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" - flag05

4)	I understood that this is a mail from root indicating to level05 that there is a root cron job executing this.
		=> The command is executed as flag05
		=> I must write a script, that will be executed once between now and in two minuts maximum through the bash script in /usr/sbin
	
5)	script.sh => getflag > /var/lock/flag
		=> It worked, got the flag
