----- LEVEL08 -----


1)	first impressions :
		-there are both an executable and a token file in the home directory.
		-binary is suid
		-token can be read only by owner (flag08)
		-./level08 token => "You may not access 'token'"
			=> I have to rename the file, or give a path that will lead to this file without its name

2)	[ebp+0x8] must not be equal to 1 in order for the program to continue.
		if strstr (of what strings ?) returns null, we don't exit.
			=> Needle must not be found in haystack in order to continue execution.
		My understanding of the asm so far :
			-x/s 0x8048793 == "token", must be a hard coded string in the main
			-program name address (argv1) + 4 is the addres of argv2 imo => token

3)	I must either :
		-find a way to reference token file without naming it.
			=> symlink not working.
		-replace hardcoded needle "token" for another string.

4)	looked on command injections in C, but asm code does not show any exploitable functions.
5)	looked the acl of files / directories, seems not to be the answer

6)	In the end, symlink was not working only because :
		-level08 had read/write permissions in /var/lock (where I created the symlink)
		-seems like flag08 must not have read permissions there.
	=> Used /tmp, symlink worked like a charm...
