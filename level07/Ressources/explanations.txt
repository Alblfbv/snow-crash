----- LEVEL07 -----


1)	first impressions :
		-binary file in the home
		-find with name/user flag07/user07 don't give anything
			=> All the exploit must be with the binary somehow.

2)	disassembled the binary
		-main : call to getenv + asprintf + system (write ?)
			=> seems like I have to tweak an environment variable to have the getflag as program is suid

4)	in the assembly, with peda.
		-breakpoints around getenv
			-getenv :
				-x/s 0x8048680 => Gives me the value of string moved on stack
					=> "LOGNAME"
			-I know that the environment variable used is LOGNAME
			-"/bin/echo %s" is hard-written, not echo in path.
				=> cannot change for my own echo binary

5)	I have to change the string in LOGNAME so that echo executes it on print ?

6)	export LOGNAME=\`getflag\`
